# CPU-Scheduling-Visualizer
This is a CPU scheduling algorithms visualizer which gives the comparison between various scheduling algorithms.

It is a an CPU visualization tool which helps us to understand the concepts of Process Management where we can see how the diffrent algorithms works inside the CPU and we visiualize it using Gant Chart which is a time series chart starting from 0 seconds.

Here the user can study the inbuilt processe or he can also create his own processes and visiualize it using the Gant Chart. We have used both Preemptive as well as Non-Preemptive algorithms. The Gant Chart shows us how the processes gets scheduled one after another inside the CPU and using this Gant chart we can find many important properties of a process such as: 
1. Throughput
2. Arrival Time (AI)
3. Burst Time (XI)
4. Completion Time (CT)
5. Turn Around Time (TAT)
6. Response Time (RT)
7. Avg. Turn Around Time (Avg. TAT)

The Algorithms whisch are used in this are:
1. First Come First serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Shortest remaining Time First (SRTF)
4. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
5. Priority Scheduling (PQ)
6. Round Robin (RR)
